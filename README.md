Mirah REPL
========
A REPL for Mirah

# Features / Problems

 - parses Mirah code, runs it, prints results out

# Is it any good?

Not yet, but I'm hopeful

# TODOs

* package it up--bin dir, gem-ify, etc
* print the value of evaluated expressions (the P in REPL)
* add a global binding
* newast support

## more experiments than TODOs
* reach into PEG parser to do partial parsing
* convert to Mirah source
* use readline, or an equivalent
* make it embeddable
